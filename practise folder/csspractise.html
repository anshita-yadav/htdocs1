    <h2 style="color: blue;">Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p style="color: brown;">Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started
        with HTML. Why? HTML is
        the
        skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is
        core to
        front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to
        create.

        So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or
        videos.
        Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.</p>

    <h3 style="background-color: yellow; height: 40px;">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:</h3>

    <p style="background-color: aqua; height: 50px; text-align: center;">A markup language is a computer language that
        defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
        In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
        HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known
        as
        hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.</p>

    <!--css border-->

    <p style="border:  solid red;">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
        layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
        separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file,
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
        improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <p style="font-size: large; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: none;">In this article, you will
        learn how to change the text size with an HTML tag.

        Before you proceed, it is essential to know that there is only one way we can do this: through CSS's font-size
        property.
        We can use the font-size property through inline, internal, or external styling.

        In the past, we could adjust text size within our HTML tag without using CSS. But that was before HTML5. Then we
        added
        text using the tag, which can take in an attribute of size as seen below:</p>
